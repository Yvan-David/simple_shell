## üìñ Project Overview

**Simple Shell** is a lightweight command-line interpreter written in **C**.  
It mimics the behavior of a basic Unix shell, allowing users to execute commands, navigate directories, and manage processes. This project is a demonstration of low-level system programming and process management in C.

The shell supports:

- Executing system commands (e.g., `ls`, `pwd`, `echo`)
- Command parsing and tokenization
- Handling arguments and multiple inputs
- Exiting the shell cleanly using `exit` or `Ctrl+D`

This project is designed to deepen understanding of:

- Process creation with `fork()`
- Program execution with `exec()` family functions
- Input/output handling
- Memory management in C
